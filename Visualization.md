# Box Plot:

A boxplot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in a clear and concise manner. The "box" represents the interquartile range (IQR), while the "whiskers" extend to show the data's spread, making it easy to identify data skewness and central tendency.

A count plot is a type of data visualization commonly used in data analysis and statistics to display the frequency or count of categorical data. It is often employed to summarize and visualize the distribution of categorical variables, such as the number of occurrences of different categories within a dataset.

# Decision_Tree_Plot:
A tree plot, in a general context, is a graphical representation of a hierarchical structure, where elements are organized in a tree-like fashion. This type of visualization is commonly used in various fields to display relationships, hierarchies, and branching structures.
